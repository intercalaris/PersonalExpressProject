A full-stack contact manager using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for adding, updating, and deleting contacts displayed as editable cards. Users can enter a name, phone number, and email. The app uses MongoDB ObjectIDs to query and manipulate database records in CRUD operations.

Technical stack includes Node.js v14.x, Express v4.x, MongoDB with MongoDB Atlas, method-override v3.x for PUT method in the "edit" HTML form, and EJS v3.x as the template engine.

Styling is a dark theme with responsive flexbox-centered layout and interactive elements with hover effects.

To run, clone the repository, install dependencies, configure the MongoDB URI, and start the server with node server.js. Access at http://localhost:8000.
